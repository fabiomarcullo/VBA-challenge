The VBA challenge involved the creation of four distinct scripts, each with its specific purpose. The Ticker Script is designed to extract and collate all available tickers, eliminate any duplicates and assemble a table to facilitate data analysis and consolidation on the Dashboard for the end user. 

The Yearly Change Script is intended to compute the variations for each ticker based on the year filter entered in cell "H3" of the "Dashboard Stock" Tab. Similarly, the Sum Stock Script is designed to determine the total volume of each ticker based on the year filter applied in cell "H3" of the "Dashboard Stock" Tab. 

Lastly, the Greatest Script computes the statistics for each ticker based on the year filter entered in cell "H3" of the "Dashboard Stock" Tab.

The scripts were meticulously developed, taking into consideration the optimization of results, and an intuitive design for the end user. The benefit of this approach is that the end user does not have to navigate through multiple tabs to view results for a given year. 

Furthermore, future updates require only the addition of a new tab for the subsequent year.

These scripts were developed by Fabio Lima, and their current version is 1.0.
