Multiple_Year_Stock_data - VBA challenge

For the VBA challenge, 4 different Scripts were created with the following purpose:

- Ticker_Script: Its purpose is to query all available Tickers, remove duplicates and assemble a table to create a Dashboard to consolidate analyzes for the end user.

- Yearly_Change Script: Its purpose is to calculate the variations of each Ticker based on the year filter applied in cell "H3" of the "Daskboard Stock" Tab.

- Sum_Stock Script: Its purpose is to calculate the total volume of each Ticker based on the year filter applied in cell "H3" of the "Daskboard Stock" Tab.

- Greatest Script: Its purpose is to calculate the statistics of each Ticker based on the year filter applied in cell "H3" of the "Daskboard Stock" Tab.

The Scripts were prepared based on the challenge request, aiming at optimizing the result and a more intuitive design for the end user. That way, he doesn't have the need to consult each tab to see the year's result, in addition to optimizing for future years where it will only be necessary to add the following year in a new tab.
